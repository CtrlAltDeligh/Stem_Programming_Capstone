The Model folder in .NET MAUI serves several important purposes. 
First and foremost, it acts as a container for classes or structures that represent your
applicationâ€™s data. These can include data models, entities, or data transfer objects (DTOs).
 By organizing these data-related components in a dedicated folder, you maintain a clear separation of concerns within your codebase.

Secondly, the Model folder contributes to better code organization.
Following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, it ensures that each layer
of your applicationâ€”view, model, and viewmodelâ€”has distinct responsibilities. 
The view handles the user interface (usually defined in XAML), the model encapsulates 
the data, and the viewmodel acts as an intermediary between the two. This separation 
simplifies maintenance and updates.

Thirdly, beyond just data representation, 
the Model folder may also contain business logic. 
For instance, if you have an Order model, it could include 
methods for computing the total price based on the items in the order. 
This encapsulation of logic within the model promotes cleaner and more modular code.

Lastly, the Model folder connects to the data access layer.
It facilitates data retrieval from databases or other data sources.
Often, services or repositories handle data access, and the model interacts
with them to provide or update data.

In summary, the Model folder plays a crucial role in structuring your 
.NET MAUI application, ensuring efficient data management and promoting good
software architecture. ðŸ˜Š
