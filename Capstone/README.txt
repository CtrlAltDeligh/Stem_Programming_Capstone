Why do we need to put in a separate folder for each component in a project?


Organization:
 Grouping related files together in folders makes it easier to find and manage code.
 You can quickly locate specific functionality without sifting through a large flat structure.

Modularity:
 Folders allow you to create modular components. 
 Each folder can represent a specific feature, module, or layer (e.g., models, views, viewmodels). This separation promotes better code isolation and reusability.

Readability:
 Well-organized folders enhance code readability.
 Developers can understand the project’s structure and navigate to the relevant files efficiently.

Scalability: 
 As your project grows, maintaining a clear folder structure becomes crucial.
 It ensures that new code integrates seamlessly and doesn’t disrupt existing functionality.
